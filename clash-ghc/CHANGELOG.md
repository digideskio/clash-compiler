## 0.6.1 *October 16th 2015*

      B -> f x x
      C -> h x
    ```

    is transformed into:

    ```haskell
    let f_arg0 = case x of {A -> 3; B -> x}
        f_arg1 = case x of {A -> y; B -> x}
        f_out  = f f_arg0 f_arg1

  * Fix Index maxBound [#79](https://github.com/clash-lang/clash-compiler/pull/79)

## 0.5.14 *September 14th 2015*
* New features:
  * Completely unroll "definitions" of some higher-order primitives with non-representable argument or result vectors:
    It is now possible to translate e.g. `f xs ys = zipWith ($) (map (+) xs) ys :: Vec 4 Int -> Vec 4 Int -> Vec 4 Int`

  * Maybe (Index n) not translatable to VHDL [#75](https://github.com/clash-lang/clash-compiler/issues/75)

## 0.5.12 *September 7th 2015*

  * Modest compilation time speed-up. Compilation time of the [I2C](https://github.com/clash-lang/clash-compiler/tree/master/examples/i2c) module on my machine went down from 43s to 24s, and maximum memory usage went down from 840 MB to 700 MB.

* Fixes bugs:
  * Bug in VHDL ROM generation [#69](https://github.com/clash-lang/clash-compiler/issues/69)
  * Clash running out of memory on Simple-ish project [#70](https://github.com/clash-lang/clash-compiler/issues/70)

## 0.5.11 *August 2nd 2015*
* New features:
  * Re-enable GHC's strictness analysis pass, which improves dead-code removal, which hopefully leads to smaller circuits.

## 0.5.10 *July 9th 2015*
* New features:
  * Use new VHDL backend which outputs VHDL-93 instead of VHDL-2002: generated VHDL is now accepted by a larger number of tools.
  * Treat all so-called bottom values (`error "FOO"`, `let x = x in x`, etc.) occuring in installed libraries as `undefined`.
    Before, there were (very) rare situations where we couldn't find the expressions belonging to a function and demanded a BlackBox, even though we knew the expression would be a bottom value.
    Now, we stop demanding a BlackBox for such a function and simply treat it as `undefined`, thus allowing a greater range of circuit descriptions that we can compile.

## 0.5.9 *June 26th 2015*
* New features:
  * Use new verilog backend which outputs Verilog-2001 instead of Verilog-2005: generated Verilog is now accepted by Altera/Quartus

* Fixes bugs:
  * `--systemverilog` switch incorrectly generates verilog code instead of systemverilog code

* New features:
  * Support for copying string literals from Haskell to generated code
  * Support `clash-prelude-0.9`
  * Size at below which functions are always inlined is configurable, run with `-clash-inline-below=N` to set the size limit to `N`

## 0.5.7 *June 3rd 2015*
* New features:
  * New Verilog backend, run `:verilog` in interactive mode, or `--verilog` for batch mode
  * Generated component names are prefixed by the name of the module containing the `topEntity`

## 0.5.6 *May 18th 2015*
* New features:
  * Inlining limit is configurable, run with `-clash-inline-limit=N` to set the inlining limit to `N`
  * Specialisation limit is configurable, run with `clash-spec-limit=N` to set the inline limit to `N`
  * Debug level is configurable, run with `-clash-debug <LEVEL>` where `<LEVEL>` can be: `DebugNone, DebugFinal, DebugName, DebugApplied, DebugAll`. Be default, `clash` runs with `DebugNone`.

* Fixes bugs:
  * Extend evaluator for `GHC.Integer.Type.minusInteger` and `CLaSH.Promoted.Nat.SNat`.

## 0.5.5 *May 5th 2015*
* New features:
